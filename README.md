# 5, 10 ... 15!

A small browser game where you and the computer race toward a safe high score without going over 15.

## Objective
Finish with a higher total (<= 15) than the computer. A total above 15 is a bust. If both bust or totals tie, it's a draw.

## How It Works
1. You start. Click a button (+1 to +5) to add to your score.
2. A random additional value (+1 to +5) is also added to the active player's score each turn.
3. Once your score exceeds 10, control switches to the computer.
4. The computer takes turns the same way until its score exceeds 10.
5. The game ends and the result is shown:
   - Highest total ≤ 15 wins.
   - Bust (> 15) loses.
   - Both bust or equal = tie.
